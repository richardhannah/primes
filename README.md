# primes
primes technical test for FMP

## instructions for running

1. Download the executable jar from the root of the project (https://github.com/richardhannah/primes/raw/master/primes-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar)
2. navigate to the downloaded jar and open a command prompt
3. execute program with java -jar <name of jar file> e.g. java -jar primes-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

### Whats good about it..

The MultiplicationTableBuilder allows different algorithms to be tried out in runtime - would do the same for formatters too.

### If I had more time

Expand the MultiplicationTableBuilder interface to handle asymmetric tables
Sort out the main Application class - remove UI and input handling to their own classes/interfaces
Create a mechanism for starting the grid at a larger prime
Try a different primes generation algorithm
